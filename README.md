# GeoMet.jl

**GeoMet.jl** is a fully written in Julia framework for modeling and calculating geometallurgical metrics.  
It currently supports the calculation of the **Bond Work Index (BWI)** for mineral processing, based on particle size, material density, and a constant.

[![Build Status](https://github.com/GeoMet-jl/GeoMet.jl/actions/workflows/CI.yml/badge.svg?branch=main)](https://github.com/GeoMet-jl/GeoMet.jl/actions/workflows/CI.yml?query=branch%3Amain)

## Features

- Scalar and DataFrame-based calculation of the Bond Work Index (BWI)
- Safe input validation

## Installation

```julia
] add GeoMet
